Pseudo code:
1. intialize game display
- display title "hot slots"
- display three random slots, could be any three different possible emojis
- display dollar amount that player has (start at $10)
- display "Spin-2-Win" button

2. press spin button
- play sound & do logic below:
- deduct $1 & disable button
- (asynchronization) start a set interval for .5 seconds that puts a random emoji in each square & starts another 
  interval for .5 seconds that puts different random emojis in each slot & then starts the final set interval for .5 seconds that
  does the logic below:
- sets the final emojis, compares if they are a winning match & pays out, & says "winner!" if it 
  is & plays sound 
- enable spin button again if the player is not out of $. if out of 
  money, game over. will say "better luck next time," displaying the 4-leaf-clover, also hide spin button



Some notes: 
- possible emojis: star, sun, fire, heart, 4-leaf clover, kissy-face emoji
- winning emojis: fire = $5; sun = $3; star = $1
- cost $1 to play 
- if game over, player must refresh page


Functionality notes: 
- function init() will call step 1 on page load
- function spin() will call step 2 when player presses spin-2-win button 
- function setRandomSlots()
- two constants: possibleEmojis, winningEmojis
- state variables: money amount, slots(array of three elements)

todo:
 -at bottom of spin function, if money is <= 0, make money go away & make message say gameover
