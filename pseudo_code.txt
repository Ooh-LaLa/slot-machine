  interval for .5 seconds that puts different random emojis in each slot & then starts the final set interval for .5 seconds that
  does the logic below:
- sets the final emojis, compares if they are a winning match & pays out, & says "winner!" if it 
  is & plays sound 
- show spin button again if the player is not out of $. if out of 
  money, game over. will say "better luck next time," displaying the 4-leaf-clover
