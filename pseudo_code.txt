  interval for .5 seconds that puts different random emojis in each slot & then starts the final set interval for .5 seconds that
  does the logic below:
- sets the final emojis, compares if they are a winning match & pays out, & says "winner!" if it 
  is & plays sound 
- enable spin button again if the player is not out of $. if out of 
  money, game over. will say "better luck next time," displaying the 4-leaf-clover, also hide spin button



Some notes: 
- possible emojis: star, sun, fire, heart, 4-leaf clover, kissy-face emoji
- winning emojis: fire = $5; sun = $3; star = $1
- cost $1 to play 
- if game over, player must refresh page


Functionality notes:

- function spin() will call step 2 when player presses spin-2-win button 
- function setRandomSlots()
